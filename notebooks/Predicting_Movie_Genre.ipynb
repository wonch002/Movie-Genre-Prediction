    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Movies are put into categories called `genres`. These genres describe the expectations that a person should have when they watch the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a data set that maps each movie title and their plot to the genre they are in. Using Natural Language Processing, we will identify what genre the movie is based on the title and plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a tool that can accurately identify these genres based on the genre and plot may help movie creators effectively write a movie title and generic plot. Once they create their title and plot, they could pass it into this model and verify that it conveys the message that they intend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a multiclass classification problem that will utilize Natural Language Processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Natural Language Processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language processing allows computers to analyze and understand human written language. Ultimately, we want to be able to parse the natural language in a way that is valuable. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts of a language that the computer needs to be able to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "Syntax describes the way we arrange words to make a sentence that is grammatically correct. Syntax is important to help the computer learn the structure of our language. It helps to learn if each sentence is grammatically correct or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantics\n",
    "Semantics describes the meaning behind each word, sentence or phrase. Semantics are important to help the computer understand the meaning behind indiviudal words and combination of words. This becomes difficult when words have more than one meaning. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I crashed my car.\n",
    "2. I crashed on my couch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the word \"crashed\" have different meanings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, \"crashed\" means destroyed or ruined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second example, \"crashed\" means sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helping a computer understand these subtle differences in meaning can be difficult to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques/Libraries to Used in NLP\n",
    "Below is a list of libraries and tools that may help us in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)\n",
    "    * https://www.nltk.org/\n",
    "    * Slow and steep learning curve \n",
    "2. TextBlob\n",
    "    * https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/\n",
    "    * Easy to learn (great for beginners!), but it is slow\n",
    "3. CoreNLP\n",
    "    * https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/\n",
    "    * Really fast and can be integrated with NLTK\n",
    "4. Gensim\n",
    "    * https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim\n",
    "    * Specializes in semantic recognition\n",
    "5. spaCy\n",
    "    * https://spacy.io/\n",
    "    * Really fast! Only supports 7 languages (Python is one of them, so we're good).\n",
    "6. polyglot\n",
    "    * https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n",
    "    * Similar performance to spaCy but supports more languages.\n",
    "7. scikitâ€“learn\n",
    "    * https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\n",
    "    * Great documentation and familiar. Does not use Neural Networks for processing, so it isn't as good.\n",
    "8. Pattern\n",
    "    * https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pages/pattern\n",
    "    * Good for webmining, but doesn't include enough NLP tasks\n",
